# Personalized Real Estate Agent â€“ AI-powered HomeMatch Assistant

Welcome to the **AI-powered HomeMatch Assistant**!  
This project leverages the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **vector search** to build a personalized real estate recommendation agent. Users are guided through a set of questions to determine their preferences, and then matched with the most suitable home listings based on semantic similarity and relevance.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a personalized AI real estate assistant that:

-  Understands customer preferences through natural conversation
-  Matches preferences to real estate listings using semantic search
-  Generates attractive, human-like descriptions of matching homes using LLMs

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Data Generation or Loading**  
   A sample dataset of home listings is used, either generated by the model or manually included in `data/home.csv`.

2. **Embedding and Vector Store**  
   Property descriptions are embedded using `OpenAIEmbeddings` and stored in a ChromaDB vector database.

3. **User Interaction**  
   The assistant asks the user five personalized questions to understand their preferences (e.g., house size, location, amenities).

4. **Semantic Matching**  
   The userâ€™s preferences are summarized and used as a semantic query against the vector store.

5. **Response Generation**  
   Using `ChatOpenAI`, a personalized, engaging property recommendation is generated and presented.
